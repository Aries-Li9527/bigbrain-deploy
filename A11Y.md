## 1. Semantic HTML and Structured Content

While building the UI with React and Material UI (MUI), I ensured that all components were constructed semantically. For instance:

- `Typography` components are used consistently for headings (`variant="h3"`, `h4`, etc.) and body content, helping screen readers interpret the document structure.
- All interactive elements—such as buttons, form fields, and links—are built using MUI’s semantic components (`<Button>`, `<TextField>`, `<Dialog>`, etc.), which come with built-in ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support.
- Tables for data presentation (e.g., in `SessionResult.jsx` and `PlayerResult.jsx`) are implemented using proper semantic structure (`<Table>`, `<TableHead>`, `<TableRow>`, `<TableCell>`), enabling assistive technologies to read them meaningfully.

## 2. Form Accessibility

All forms in the application (e.g., login, registration, question editing) follow accessibility best practices:

- Each form field is accompanied by a visible `label` or uses `aria-label` for clarity.
- Relevant `type` attributes (`email`, `password`, `number`) are specified to support both browser validation and screen reader context.
- Required fields are clearly indicated and enforced at the frontend to prevent silent failures.
- Error messages are provided via `Snackbar` and `Alert` components, which offer clear, high-contrast visual feedback and are perceivable by screen readers.

## 3. Keyboard Navigation and Dialog Control

- All user flows can be completed using keyboard navigation alone.
- Dialogs (such as the session popup modal) are implemented using MUI’s `Dialog` component, which supports keyboard focus trapping, Escape key dismissal, and semantic labeling via `DialogTitle`, `DialogContent`, and `DialogActions`.
- Buttons within dialogs are arranged with logical tab order, and all modals can be navigated without a mouse.

## 4. Visual Feedback and Interaction States

The application provides clear feedback during all asynchronous interactions:

- Buttons display a loading state when an action is in progress (e.g., "Registering...", "Starting..."), helping users understand that their action has been acknowledged.
- Form submission errors and other alerts are delivered through clearly styled components that appear in predictable positions.

## 5. Responsive Design and Readability

- All screens are responsive and accessible on various devices, including mobile. Layouts adjust using Material UI's breakpoint system to ensure adequate spacing and font scaling.
- Font sizes and spacing are carefully chosen to improve legibility, especially in key pages like the login form, game dashboard, and result views.

---

## 6. Contrast and Non-Color-Dependent Cues

- The application uses high-contrast color schemes for key interactions and avoids relying solely on color to convey meaning.
- For instance, in result tables and answer selections, correctness is conveyed via text ("Yes", "No") and not by color alone.
- Alerts and feedback components use iconography and clear language alongside color to ensure redundancy.

## 7. Accessible Data Visualisation

- In `SessionResult.jsx`, all charts are rendered using the Recharts library with tooltips enabled, allowing users to hover and read numerical data in text form.
- Bar and line charts use distinct, accessible colors and are accompanied by descriptive headings and summaries to provide context to all users.

## Summary

Accessibility has been a key consideration across the design and development of this project. While there is always room for further improvement (e.g., expanding ARIA support on custom interactions and improving screen reader announcements on dynamic page changes), I believe this application demonstrates a strong commitment to inclusive design and a solid implementation of the accessibility principles taught in this course.
