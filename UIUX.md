## 1. Clear Navigation and Consistent Layout

- The application uses a persistent `Navbar` at the top of every screen (except when playing), providing access to `Login`, `Register`, and `Logout` actions depending on the authentication state.
- Routes are defined cleanly using React Router with clear URLs (`/dashboard`, `/game/:id`, `/play/:session_id`, etc.), ensuring users understand where they are within the app.
- Main content is consistently centered and spaced using responsive containers (`Box`, `Container`) with controlled padding and margins, ensuring visual clarity across devices.

## 2. Strong Visual Hierarchy and Typography

- `Typography` components are used throughout with distinct variants for headers (`h4`, `h5`) and body text, ensuring users can easily distinguish between headings, labels, and content.
- Button texts use action-oriented language (e.g., “Start Game”, “Submit”, “Edit Question”) to clearly convey intent.
- Important status indicators, such as score summaries, session states, and modal titles, are prominently displayed in larger or bold font.

## 3. Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Design

- All pages adapt gracefully to smaller screens using Material UI’s responsive `sx` system (e.g., adjusting `flexDirection`, `gap`, font size).
- Form layouts, question views, and result summaries stack vertically on mobile while remaining horizontally aligned on desktop, providing an optimal experience on any device.

---

## 4. Minimalist and Focused Interactions

- Dialogs are used sparingly and purposefully—for example, creating a new game, confirming session links, or inputting a new question. These dialogs reduce cognitive load by limiting the user’s attention to a single task.
- Buttons are appropriately sized and spaced, and non-essential UI elements are hidden or collapsed until needed.

---

## 5. Immediate and Helpful Feedback

- All user actions (e.g., submitting a form, starting a game, deleting a question) are followed by clear feedback:
  - Success actions result in confirmation alerts or UI updates.
  - Errors are communicated through `Snackbar` and `Alert`, placed at the top and styled with strong contrast.
- Loading states on buttons (e.g., `Starting...`, `Registering...`) reassure users that their action is in progress and prevent double submissions.

---

## 6. Progressive Disclosure of Information

- The dashboard presents only essential game summaries at a glance (e.g., name, number of questions, total duration).
- Users can progressively drill down into individual games, questions, or session details as needed.
- This avoids overwhelming the user with all data at once and improves mental model clarity.

---

## 7. Accessible, Touch-Friendly UI Elements

- All form inputs and buttons are designed with adequate padding and hit areas to be easily usable on touchscreens.
- Select inputs, file uploaders, and modals all follow standard UI patterns that users are familiar with.

---

## 8. Visual Representations for Data

- Player and session results include both textual summaries and visualizations (charts), making it easy for users to understand key metrics like average time, correct rate, and score distribution at a glance.
- Charts are accompanied by contextual headings and legends to prevent confusion and improve scanability.

## Summary

I have designed the application with a focus on clarity, feedback, responsiveness, and ease of use. Through the use of consistent UI components, well-labeled actions, logical information grouping, and responsive layouts, this app aims to provide a smooth and intuitive experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

All interaction flows have been tested for usability, and visual consistency has been maintained across all screens, from registration to gameplay and result review.
